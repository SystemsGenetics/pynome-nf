 * =============================================================================
 * This file provides the configuration settings for the Pynome-nf workflow.
 * It is designed to provide workflow parameter settings in this file. These
 * are the settings needed for proper execution of the workflow processes. More
 * advanced configuration settings are avilable via included configuration
 * files that are found in the ./config directory.
 *
 * Most users will only need to edit the settings in this file and
 * the appropriate profile settings file if executing Pynome other than
 * standalone.  Pynome provides default configuration files for
 * Standalone Docker, Standalone Singularity, PBS cluster, SLURM cluster and
 * a Kubernetes cluster.
